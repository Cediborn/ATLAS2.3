A consensus protocol needs to reach agreement despite all of that.\n\n## Paxos\n- **Prepare phase**: proposer asks acceptors for a promise\n- **Accept phase**: proposer sends a value, acceptors accept or reject\n- Safety comes from majority quorums overlapping\n\n## Raft (the practical alternative)\nRaft splits the problem into three understandable pieces:\n1. Leader election\n2. Log replication\n3. Safety\n\n> Raft is Paxos, but written for humans to actually implement.\n\n## Benchmark to run before Friday\n`ping-pong latency across 5 regions, 10k requests, p50/p95/p99`\n\nStill need to compare against my thesis chapter's assumptions.",
